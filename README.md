# Sales-and-Customer-Insights

## Description:
Worked on a SQL-based data exploration project involving relational data across agents, customers, and orders. The goal was to extract actionable insights and perform business-oriented analysis using structured queries.

## Key Highlights:
- Retrieved agent details along with associated customer records using JOIN operations.
- Analyzed order volumes and values by customer and agent.
- Used GROUP BY, HAVING, and ORDER BY clauses for trend insights and performance summaries.
- Applied filtering with WHERE and IN to isolate specific transaction patterns.
- Wrote nested queries and subqueries to answer complex business questions (e.g., top-performing agents, inactive customers).
- Optimized queries for performance and readability.

## Tech Stack:
